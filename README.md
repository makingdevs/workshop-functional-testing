# Workshop: Functional testing...
## with Selenium

This workshop pretends to show some features about the Selenium usage. This talk was presented in SG Next 2016; the technologies are Java based but it doesn't matters because we can use another kind of platform.

To start this workshop you should:

- Download and unzip this repo
- Go to the directory in your command line
- In your CLI type:
  - For _*nix_ `./gradlew build`
  - For _windows_ `gradlew.bat build`
- Alternatively you can install the SDKMAN tool from http://sdkman.io/install.html
- After that, please install Groovy: `sdk install groovy`
- And Gradle(2.9): `sdk install gradle 2.9`
- In the code you find some test with node, so if you wish, install it please

And that's all, you now have all the dependencies for run this repo.

We recommend you use some text editor or IDE like IntelliJ Idea.
